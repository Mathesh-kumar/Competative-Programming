# Sort an integer array
# Using Quick Sort

## Why quick sort?
  1. Highly efficient sorting algorithm
  2. Based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays
  3. Uses Divide and Conquer algorithm

## Time complexity of quick sort
  1. Best    : Ω(n log(n))	
  2. Average : θ(n log(n))	
  3. Worst   : O(n^2)
