Alternate sorting: Given an array of integers, 
rearrange the array in such a way that the first element is first maximum and 
second element is first minimum and repeat the same sorting for the subsequent pairs

first element - first maximum
second element - first minimum
third element - second maximum
fourth element - second minimum ....

Example:
Input : {5, 7, 3, 1, 4, 6, 2}
Output : {7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4}
