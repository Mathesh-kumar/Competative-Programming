Assume a two dimensional string array. Each array contains child and father details. 
'0'th element is the child and '1'st is the parent. 
Write a program to accept a name and find the number of children and grand children he has. 
Don't use any brute force methods. 
Assume names are unique.

Example:

Data:
[
	[Surya, Sivakumar],
	[Karthi, Sivakumar],
	[Sivakumar, Rakkaiya],
	[Dev, Surya],
	[Umayaal, Karthi],
	[Diya, Surya],
	[Prabu, Sivaji],
	[Vikram, Prabu]
]

Input: Surya, 1		// 1 indicates the number of children Surya has
Output: 2

Input: Karthi, 1
Output: 1

Input: Sivakumar, 2		// 2 indicates the number of grandchildren Sivakumar has
Output: 3
